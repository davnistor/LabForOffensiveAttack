# LabForOffensiveAttack
## current situation
Arp poisoning should work, automatically initiates the attackers mac and ip address. The victims are manually entered, still no automation in that part.

## next steps 
* ssl strip module
* decide how the user or the program chooses victims
* refactor code after implemented previous steps (to work for multiple pairs of victims for example)

## next next steps
* see why dns spoof does not work as it should
* make ssl strip

## main idea, arp poisoning places us in the middle, thus dns spoofing and ssl stripping becomes possible
